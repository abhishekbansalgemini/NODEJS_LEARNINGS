REST

Representational state transfer
 
 -> software architectural style which governs the interaction b/w client and server

 REST ---> Restful Routes && Rest APi

 in RestFul Routes: We render a whole page... like we make request at /user and it will render the whole page.

 In Rest API: API are nothing but the URLs on which we make the request and it give us back some data  


 // PUT vs PATCH

// let suppose we want to update the comments, if we want to replace the whole comment with the new comment, we use put 
request otherwise we will use patch request
