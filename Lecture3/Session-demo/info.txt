// Sessions

// Server Side Storage

Store data in form of key-value pairs

Inside program memory, there is memory for sessions

when you send request from client to server, suppose you are requesting at abc.com, then in response server send the cookie
in which session id is stored and that session id will get store inside the browser

 as we know, cookies are sent with each subsequent request when we set them once. so if one user hits differnt route then
 cookie will sent with that request containing some data and session id to the server and server has stored all the session ids 
 in a program memory from where he match that session id and perform specific task
